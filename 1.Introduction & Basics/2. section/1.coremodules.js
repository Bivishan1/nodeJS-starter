//when installing node.js, some of the modules built- in in nod.js are called core modules.
//these modules are already installed in node.js, so we don't need to install them again.
//for example, like:
//os module = to get the information about OS // const os = require('os'); where 'os' is a core module.
//path module = to determine the path of the file
//fs module = to work with the file system like, to create, delete, read, write & update file etc.
//http module = to create a server //only study until this.
//https module = to create a secure server
//url module = to work with the URL
